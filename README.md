# Introduction

### The purpose/importance of the project 🎯🚀
Our project focuses on exploring the intricate relationships between various factors—such as academic major, dietary habits, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic—and mental health among college students. We aim to leverage an interactive web application to analyze and visualize data gathered from health surveys and academic records. This approach allows us to identify and understand patterns and trends that may influence students' mental well-being, providing a foundation for targeted mental health strategies and interventions within academic communities.

### Key features of the Shiny App 🌟
- **Interactive Data Visualization** 📊: 
  - Explore the dataset through various interactive charts and graphs.
  - Visualize correlations between different factors impacting mental health.
  
- **Resources and Insights** 💡: 
  - Discover ways to make positive changes in mental health.
  - Access resources for more information and guidance on mental health and various contributing factors.
  
- **Data/Charts Summary**  📈: 
  - Use tables and charts to present quantitative aspects of the dataset.
  - Address related research questions and provide context for the findings.

### Main questions 🤔❓
The major questions we are seeking to answer:

1. **How does different factor contribute to students mental health and focusing on screen time, stress and diet?**
2. **Are certain academic majors more likely to be associated with higher levels of stress?**
3. **How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect the mental and academic well-being of college students?**

### Data Source 📊📚
The data for our study was sourced from Kaggle, a platform for data science competitions and datasets. The dataset was compiled by **AKILESH S**, who gathered the data to analyze mental health issues among college students. There are 468 observations (rows) and 18 features (columns) in the dataset. The data was generated through survey responses provided by the students. These responses were self-reported, based on personal feelings or perceptions related to various aspects of mental health. As firsthand data provided by real college students in real time, the data is appropriate for our research on students' mental health.[Link to the Original Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akilesh23/student-mental-health-issues/data)

### Ethical Questions and Limitations 🛑🤔
When working with this data, ethical considerations include ensuring the anonymity and confidentiality of the respondents. It's crucial to handle the data in a way that respects the privacy of the individuals involved and avoids any misuse of sensitive information about their mental health. The dataset presents several limitations. The reliance on self-reported responses may lead to inaccuracies due to subjective interpretations of personal mental health states. The short duration of data collection and concentration of respondents from specific departments (e.g., CSE) may not accurately reflect broader trends and may skew results towards particular demographics. The design of the survey, which in some cases restricted responses to a single choice where multiple responses might be applicable, could result in an incomplete representation of the students' mental health conditions and behaviors. The uneven gender distribution with a higher percentage of male respondents might introduce a bias, potentially impacting the findings and their generalizability to the entire student population. All these factors necessitate a cautious approach to interpreting the findings, considering the potential biases and limitations inherent in the dataset. Further research, perhaps with a more robust and comprehensive data collection method, would be beneficial to deepen the understanding of mental health dynamics among students.


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways


1. **Mental health among college students can be due to different factor**
As shown in the data table below, it is obvious that factors such as spending too much time on screen, external stress and diet have an impact on one's mental health condition. More than 50% of student in college expereince mental health issues which is stemed from these factos. in Fact, a study has shown that in the united states specifically, it is estimated that up to or more that 50% of those who experience mental health problem, about 31% show an average prevalnce of depression. The quality of food that we consume on the daily can have major effect on our health. For example: eating fruits and vegitables along with protiens daily and eating junk foods daily are different when it comes to the effects they have on our bodies and our brains. Understanding this correlation between food and mental health is important as it can have implications in the way eat and care for our health.

2. **Stress is closely linked to students' majors**
As shown in the chart below, it is evident that regardless of their major, students in technical fields experience the most stress during exams, as the standards for these exams always tend to be higher than those in other fields. Particularly, CSE majors appear most frequently in every stress source bar, indicating that CSE students consistently endure higher stress levels than students in any other major, or/and that there are significantly more students majoring in CSE. Given that the data/tech-related majors are known for tough exams and consistent career popularity, it is not surprising that student stress is correlated with their majors, especially for CSE students.

3. **Students who experience negative mental impacts from COVID tend to achieve better academic performance**.
According to the table below, more students reported negative mental impacts from COVID-19 compared to those who reported positive mental impacts. For both groups, the median CGPA is the same. However, students who reported negative mental impacts have higher 25th and 75th percentile CGPAs, indicating that these students tend to have higher grades and a more centralized grade distribution. These values may also suggest that this group of students with higher academic performance experience more worries about future/peer pressure/academic anxiety compounded by COVID-19's negative mental effects. We shall always remember that grade is only a small part of life, and thus, we cannot conclude that students suffering negative mental impacts from COVID have better overall well-being merely due to their tendency for better academic performance.

### The most important insight and broader implications 💡🌍
**In conclusion**, the most important insight is that we should not think about mental health issues based on common prejudices and stereotypes. Many individuals always unintentionally hold a prejudice that students' mental health conditions are mainly related to academic performances since their lives are centered on learning, but it turns out that factors that we tend to ignore, such as diet and screen time, also influence students' mental health. Similarly, a common stereotype is that negative mental impacts definitely lead to some worse outcomes in every aspect of life, but the data shows that students suffering from COVID-19's negative mental effects tend to have higher grades. Extending to broader areas, since every person's mind is limited to some degree, the best starting point for analyzing or learning something is to discard pre-assumptions and study the facts such as data. Though due to many reasons, facts are not guaranteed to be fully trustable, they do offer people a chance to rethink and embrace a more diverse mindset.
