# Introduction

### The purpose/importance of the project
Our project focuses on exploring the intricate relationships between various factors—such as academic major, dietary habits, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic—and mental health among college students. We aim to leverage an interactive web application to analyze and visualize data gathered from health surveys and academic records. This approach allows us to identify and understand patterns and trends that may influence students' mental well-being, providing a foundation for targeted mental health strategies and interventions within academic communities.

### Key features of the Shiny App
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: 
  - Explore the dataset through various interactive charts and graphs.
  - Visualize correlations between different factors impacting mental health.
  
- **Resources and Insights**: 
  - Discover ways to make positive changes in mental health.
  - Access resources for more information and guidance on mental health and various contributing factors.
  
- **Data/Charts Summary**: 
  - Use tables and charts to present quantitative aspects of the dataset.
  - Address related research questions and provide context for the findings.

### Main questions
The major questions we are seeking to answer:

1. **How does different factor contribute to students mental health and focusing on screen time, stress and diet?**
2. **Are certain academic majors more likely to be associated with higher levels of stress?**
3. **How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect the mental and academic well-being of college students?**

### Data Source
The data for our study was sourced from Kaggle, a platform for data science competitions and datasets. The dataset was compiled by **AKILESH S**, who gathered the data to analyze mental health issues among college students. There are 468 observations (rows) and 18 features (columns) in the dataset. The data was generated through survey responses provided by the students. These responses were self-reported, based on personal feelings or perceptions related to various aspects of mental health. As firsthand data provided by real college students in real time, the data is appropriate for our research on students' mental health.[Link to the Original Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akilesh23/student-mental-health-issues/data)

### Ethical Questions and Limitations
When working with this data, ethical considerations include ensuring the anonymity and confidentiality of the respondents. It's crucial to handle the data in a way that respects the privacy of the individuals involved and avoids any misuse of sensitive information about their mental health. The dataset presents several limitations. The reliance on self-reported responses may lead to inaccuracies due to subjective interpretations of personal mental health states. The short duration of data collection and concentration of respondents from specific departments (e.g., CSE) may not accurately reflect broader trends and may skew results towards particular demographics. The design of the survey, which in some cases restricted responses to a single choice where multiple responses might be applicable, could result in an incomplete representation of the students' mental health conditions and behaviors. The uneven gender distribution with a higher percentage of male respondents might introduce a bias, potentially impacting the findings and their generalizability to the entire student population. All these factors necessitate a cautious approach to interpreting the findings, considering the potential biases and limitations inherent in the dataset. Further research, perhaps with a more robust and comprehensive data collection method, would be beneficial to deepen the understanding of mental health dynamics among students.
